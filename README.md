## Game play

The game is started when the webpage is opened.  Choose two cards from the 16 cards available.  If the cards match, they will remain visible.  If the cards do not match they will flip back.  Choose cards again until all the matches are found.

The game will track the number of moves it takes to find the matches as well as the time it takes.

The game will provide a star rating based on the number of moves it takes to complete the game.
